BlackJack Game with Card Counting Trainer
Author: Stan Urbanek
Date: April 11, 2018

Info: [Version 1.1] A BlackJack game simulator with a Card Counting Trainer.
      Initial inpiration was from an interview question I was asked
      'How would you design a BlackJack simulation?'

      Currently, the game is played with 1 deck between the dealer and player.
      After each round, the player will have opportunity to compare their own
      "running count" to the actual running count, a number used to count cards.

To run: python3 BlackJack.py

Misc Rules: Dealer hits on hard 16, soft 17
     	    Card trainer implements a hi-lo count

Future Versions: Use 2+ Decks, 2-5 Players
       		 Add Betting, based on "running counts"

Structure: There are 4 classes
  -> Game        - Handles game play. Game contains all other objects
  -> Deck        - Tracks the deck, chooses cards
  -> Player      - Handles player's hand and interaction with Deck
  -> CardCounter - Counts cards, logs and desplays hands
