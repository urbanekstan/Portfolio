Languages: Python, LAMMPS (by Sandia National Labs)

Info: This is research by simulations of Methane diffusion through shale rock after fracking. CNTs used to simulate microscopic pores in shale rock. This was a year long research initiative.

NOTE: Ask me for videos of the simulation! 

Scripts:
 > SimulationVectors.py : Python script that outputs 3D positions of carbon locations in Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)

 > in.meamCNT : LAMMPS file that defines Carbon Nanotube using MEAM potential

 > in.SimulationMethaneInCNT : LAMMPS Script that populates CNT with methane, then drives methane through it
