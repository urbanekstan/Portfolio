This is a portfolio designed to showcase some of my work over the years.
Languages include Python, C++, Bash Shell Scripting, and LAMMPS (by Sandia National Labs)

All code from my 2 years at Applied Research Laboratories is missing, as it
was proprietary and protected by a Department of Defense Security Clearance.
