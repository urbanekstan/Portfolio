SUMMARY: This is a portfolio designed to show some of the scripts that I have written myself.

GUIDE: A.name = Source A; B.name = Source B; etc..

SOURCES:

  A) CURRENT PROJECTS on Raspberry Pi server

  B) RESEARCH SIMULATION of Methane diffusion through shale rock after fracking. CNTs used to simulate microscopic pores in shale rock. This was a year long research initiative.

   I have videos of the simulation if you are interested. 

   Languages: Python, LAMMPS (by Sandia National Labs), Bash (shell script)
