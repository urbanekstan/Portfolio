TLDR: Check out

      -> A.SimulationVectors.py
      	 = Script that outputs 3D positions of carbon locations in Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)
      -> B.BinaryTree.py or B.LinkedLists.py
      	 = Python script demonstrating binary trees and linked lists

SUMMARY: This is a portfolio designed to show some of the scripts that I have written myself.
	
GUIDE: A.name = Source A; B.name = Source B; etc..

There are a few sources:

A) Simulation of Methane diffusion through shale rock after fracking. CNTs used to simulate microscopic pores in shale rock. This was year long research.

   I have videos of the simulation if you are interested. 

   Languages: LAMMPS (by Sandia National Labs), Python
