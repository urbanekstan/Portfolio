This is a portfolio designed to show some of the scripts that I have written myself.

There are a few sources
1) CS 303E - ELEMENTS OF COMPUTERS/PROGRAMMING
   Intro to Python Programming class taken in 2013
   Demonstrates Basic python programming and script documentation

2) CS 313E - ELEMENTS OF SOFTWARE DESIGN
   Class on Search & Store Algorithms (binary trees, linked lists), OOP



Python scripts from an early Computer Science class I took in 2014 (CS 303WE Elements of Computers/Programming)
Demonstates: Documentation of scripts, OOP, Basic python programming
