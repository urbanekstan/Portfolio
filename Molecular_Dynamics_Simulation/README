Molecular Dynamics Simulation

Info: Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Methane, which is a natural gas
      found trapped under shale rock under the Earth's surface. The application
      is to hydrofracturing (a.k.a. "fracking"), as the methane diffuses
      through nanopores in shale rock after shale rock is fracked.

      I was research lead for this project, under guidance of Dr. Michael
      Marder, for my University of Texas senior year project. It was accepted
      as completion for a Certificate of Scientific Computation.

      Written in Python and LAMMPS

Outline:
      MethaneDiffusionSimluation.pdf - Final research paper outlining the
      	application, the process, the simulation, and the results.

      SimulationMethaneContained.mpg - Video of initialized simulation, of
        the carbon nanotube (simulation of nanopore) containing the methane.

      in.* - LAMMPS scripts

      *.py - Python scripts used for initializing atom locations

      honeycombAtomicPlacement.txt - text file to hold atom locations, which
        gets fed into LAMMPS scripts
